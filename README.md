# Kevin Leader Individual Project

This repository is of an individual project for Madison College's Enterprise Java Course.

### Problem Statement

There aren't many straightforward rankings for budget videogames. There are of course the current best games,
current budget games, best classic games, best games for different genres, etc. Is it possible to rank games based on
their value, such as rating over price? Can there be multiple rankings on different parameters? Can it be programmatic?

This project solves these questions by using APIs to gather data about game ratings and prices and displaying
rankings based on user-chosen parameters.
